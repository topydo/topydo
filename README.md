topydo is a todo list application using the [todo.txt format][1]. It is heavily
inspired by the [todo.txt CLI][2] by Gina Trapani. This tool is actually a
merge between the todo.txt CLI and a [number of extensions][3] that I wrote
on top of the CLI, hereafter refered to as todo.txt-tools. These extensions
are:

* Set **due** and **start dates**;
* Custom sorting;
* Dealing with tags;
* Maintain **dependencies** between todo items;
* Allow todos to **recur**;
* Some conveniences when adding new items (e.g. adding creation date and use
  **relative dates**);

Consult the [wiki][4] for more information about the features and on how to
use topydo.
