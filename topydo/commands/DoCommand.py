It is also possible to mark todo items as complete with an EXPRESSION using the
-e flag. Use -x to also process todo items that are normally invisible (as with
the 'ls' subcommand).

In case a todo has subitems (dependencies), a question is asked whether the
subitems should be marked as completed as well. When --force is given, no
interaction is required and the subitems are not marked completed.

In case a completed todo is recurring, a new todo will be added to the list,
while the given todo item is marked as complete. The new date is calculated
based on the todo item's due date. If the due date is in the past, today's date
is used to calculate the new recurrence date. Using --strict prevents this, and
then the actual due date of the todo item is used to calculate the new
recurrence date. Note that a future due date is always used as such to
calculate the new due date.

Use --date to set a custom completion date.\
