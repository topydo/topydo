        Sets up the basic properties for executing a subcommand.

        p_args is a list of arguments that can be passed to this subcommand.
        These can be retrieved with argument().

        p_todolist is a reference to the todolist instance to operate on.

        to a noop.

        and returns the answer to that prompt (normally entered by the user in
        some way). The default is a noop prompt.
